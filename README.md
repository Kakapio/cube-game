# Cube Game

## Technical Information

Project was implemented with OpenTK and C#. OpenTK is a binding for OpenGL that was used to setup the rendering systems to properly display the cubes. I adding culling and chunking techniques to my code to increase performance. This ensures that only visible faces and vertices get sent to the GPU buffer before being rendered. I also have texture support in this project to give blocks some color.
